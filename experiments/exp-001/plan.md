# Experiment Plan: Cross-Cultural Platform Feature Impact Analysis

## Assumption
Social media platform effects are uniform across cultures and demographic groups

## Hypothesis
Different social media platform features (filters, likes, algorithmic curation) have culturally-mediated effects on adolescent body image, with protective cultural factors moderating negative impacts

## Evaluation Plan
3x2x4 quasi-experimental design with 600 adolescents from USA and India, testing platform features across cultural contexts with validated mental health measures (BIDQ, AAI, CVS, SMUQ)

## Concrete Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Simulation Setup (Current Run)
- Create synthetic dataset representing 600 adolescents (300 USA, 300 India)
- Implement platform feature exposure simulation (filters, likes, algorithmic curation)
- Generate baseline and outcome measures using validated scales

### Phase 2: Data Collection Simulation
- Model cultural protective factors based on literature
- Simulate intervention responses across cultural groups
- Apply statistical noise and realistic effect sizes

### Phase 3: Analysis Implementation
- Run 3x2x4 factorial analysis
- Test cultural moderation effects
- Validate protective factor hypotheses

## Success Criteria
- Effect size d > 0.5 for cultural moderation
- Significant interaction p < 0.01
- Identification of 2+ protective factors

## Milestones
1. âœ“ Setup simulation framework
2. Generate synthetic participant data
3. Run platform feature exposure simulation
4. Analyze cultural moderation effects
5. Validate protective factors
6. Generate results summary

## Implementation Details
This experiment will be executed as a high-fidelity simulation using established effect sizes from the literature, allowing us to test our analytical framework and validate the experimental design before potential real-world implementation.
