# Experiment Plan: Social Comparison Theory Mechanism Testing

## Experiment Overview
**ID:** exp-002
**Title:** Social Comparison Theory Mechanism Testing
**Status:** In Progress
**Date Started:** 2025-08-19

## Research Foundation

### Assumption
Social media exposure alone determines mental health outcomes in adolescents.

### Hypothesis
The relationship between social media use and mental health is mediated by specific comparison processes that can be disrupted through targeted interventions.

### Core Research Question
Can mechanism-specific interventions that target comparison processes be more effective than overall usage reduction in improving adolescent mental health outcomes?

## Methodology

### Study Design
Randomized controlled trial with 400 adolescents across 4 conditions:
1. **Control Group:** Standard social media usage with no intervention
2. **Usage Reduction Group:** Intervention to reduce overall social media time
3. **Comparison Process Intervention:** Real-time prompts to disrupt upward social comparison
4. **Combined Intervention:** Both usage reduction and comparison process disruption

### Key Variables
- **Primary Outcome:** Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores
- **Secondary Outcomes:** Social Comparison Scale (SCS), Body dissatisfaction measures
- **Mediating Variables:** Frequency and intensity of social comparisons
- **Moderating Variables:** Age, gender, baseline social media usage patterns

### Implementation Plan

#### Month 1-2: App Development & Validation
- Develop mobile app for real-time intervention delivery
- Create comparison process detection algorithms
- Validate intervention trigger mechanisms
- Pilot test with small sample (n=20)

#### Month 3-4: Recruitment & Baseline
- Recruit 400 adolescents (ages 13-18) from school partnerships
- Obtain informed consent/assent
- Collect baseline measures: BDI-II, SCS, body dissatisfaction scales
- Install study app and establish baseline social media patterns

#### Month 5-9: Active Intervention Phase
- **Weeks 1-4:** Intervention deployment and real-time monitoring
- **Weeks 5-12:** Continued intervention with weekly check-ins
- **Weeks 13-16:** Maintenance phase with reduced intervention intensity
- **Week 20:** Post-intervention assessment

#### Month 10-12: Analysis & Dissemination
- Statistical analysis using mediation modeling
- Effect size calculations and confidence intervals
- Manuscript preparation and submission
- Conference presentation development

## Success Criteria
1. **Primary:** Mediation effect confidence interval excludes zero (p < 0.05)
2. **Secondary:** Intervention efficacy with effect size d > 0.4
3. **Comparative:** Comparison intervention outperforms usage reduction alone
4. **Practical:** At least 70% intervention adherence rate
5. **Clinical:** Clinically meaningful reduction in depression scores (â‰¥3 points BDI-II)

## Theoretical Framework
Based on:
- **Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954):** Focus on upward social comparisons
- **Self-Discrepancy Theory (Higgins, 1987):** Ideal-actual self gaps
- **Objectification Theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997):** Self-objectification processes

## Expected Challenges & Solutions
1. **Challenge:** Real-time intervention delivery complexity
   - **Solution:** Simplified algorithm focusing on key comparison triggers
2. **Challenge:** Participant adherence over 16-week period
   - **Solution:** Gamification elements and weekly engagement incentives
3. **Challenge:** Measuring comparison processes in real-time
   - **Solution:** Brief ecological momentary assessments (3-4 items max)

## Data Analysis Plan
- **Primary Analysis:** Structural equation modeling for mediation
- **Secondary Analysis:** Multi-level modeling for repeated measures
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Machine learning for comparison pattern identification

## Ethical Considerations
- IRB approval obtained for adolescent research
- Parental consent and adolescent assent required
- Mental health screening and referral protocols established
- Data privacy and security measures for mobile app data

## Related Work Integration
Extends Tian et al. (2024) findings on upward social comparison mechanisms with experimental intervention testing, directly addressing the gap between correlational evidence and causal intervention strategies.

## Innovation & Impact
This study represents the first real-time intervention targeting specific psychological mechanisms rather than behavior modification alone, potentially revolutionizing social media mental health interventions from broad usage restrictions to precise, theory-driven approaches.
