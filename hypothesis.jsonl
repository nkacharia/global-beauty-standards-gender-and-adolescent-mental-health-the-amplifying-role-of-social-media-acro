{"id":"social-comparison-amplification","assumption":"Social media simply provides another venue for social comparison, similar to traditional media","hypothesis":"Social media uniquely amplifies social comparison through algorithmic curation, quantifiable feedback, and constant availability, creating qualitatively different effects than traditional media","impact":"High - fundamentally changes how we understand social media's role in mental health; suggests platform design interventions could be highly effective","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"gender-universal-effects","assumption":"Social media effects on body image and mental health are relatively uniform across genders","hypothesis":"Social media creates a 'perfect storm' specifically for adolescent girls through intersection of platform features with gender socialization and developmental vulnerabilities, while boys face distinct but different pressures","impact":"High - requires gender-specific intervention approaches and challenges one-size-fits-all social media policies","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"western-beauty-standards-dominance","assumption":"Western thin-ideal beauty standards are the primary global influence on adolescent body image","hypothesis":"Beauty standard globalization now includes diverse cultural influences (East Asian perfectionism, South Asian colorism, post-colonial Eurocentric ideals) creating complex, intersecting pressures that vary by cultural context","impact":"High - expands intervention targets beyond Western thin-ideal; requires culturally-adapted approaches; challenges universal body positivity messages","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"body-image-unidimensional","assumption":"Body image can be treated as a single construct in research and intervention","hypothesis":"Body image satisfaction includes distinct domains (appearance, weight, attribution) that respond differently to identity development, social comparison, and cultural factors","impact":"Medium - suggests need for domain-specific interventions and measurement approaches","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"cultural-vulnerability-universal","assumption":"All cultures are equally vulnerable to social media beauty standard pressures","hypothesis":"Cultural values and historical contexts create differential vulnerability and protective effects, with some cultures showing resilience factors that could inform intervention development","impact":"High - suggests cultural protective factors could be leveraged; challenges assumptions about universal social media harm","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"intervention-individual-focus","assumption":"Interventions should focus primarily on individual-level factors (self-esteem, media literacy, coping skills)","hypothesis":"Effective interventions require multi-level approaches addressing platform design, family systems, cultural narratives, and structural factors alongside individual resilience","impact":"High - fundamentally shifts intervention paradigm from individual to systemic approaches; has policy implications","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"emerging"}
{"id":"developmental-stage-uniform","assumption":"Social media effects are consistent across adolescent developmental stages","hypothesis":"Social media effects interact with specific developmental tasks (identity formation, peer relationship salience) creating stage-specific vulnerabilities and requiring developmentally-tailored interventions","impact":"Medium - suggests need for age-specific intervention timing and approaches","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:02:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
