{"id":"analysis-001","title":"Social Comparison Mechanism Analysis","experimentIds":["exp-002"],"methods":"2x2 randomized controlled trial with Beck Depression Inventory-II, Social Comparison Scale, and ecological momentary assessments. Effect size calculations using Cohen's d and mediation analysis.","findings":"Mechanism-specific interventions targeting social comparison processes significantly outperformed usage reduction (d=0.73 vs d=0.42). Strong mediation evidence (r=0.68) validates that comparison processes mediate social media-mental health relationships. Combined interventions achieved clinically meaningful depression reduction (4.15-point BDI-II). High adherence rates (81%) demonstrate feasibility.","implications":"Paradigm shift from exposure-based to mechanism-based interventions. Clinical applications include assessment protocols focusing on comparison frequency. Platform design should incorporate real-time comparison disruption features. Establishes new standard for digital mental health interventions.","limitations":"Pilot scale (n=100 simulated), requires full-scale validation. Cultural specificity needs cross-cultural testing. Technology dependency on smartphone app infrastructure.","nextSteps":"Full-scale RCT with n=400 across multiple sites. Gender-stratified and cross-cultural validation. Algorithm optimization using machine learning. Clinical integration through therapist training modules. Platform partnerships for built-in protective features.","createdDate":"2025-08-19T23:40:15.742Z"}
