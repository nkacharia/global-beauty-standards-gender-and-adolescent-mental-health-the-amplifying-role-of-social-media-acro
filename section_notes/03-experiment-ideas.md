# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This experimental framework tests core assumptions about how global beauty standards and social media platforms impact adolescent mental health. Following Computer Science-inspired research methodology, each experiment challenges specific assumptions identified in the literature while providing rigorous evaluation of hypotheses through controlled comparisons and measurable outcomes.

**Core Research Assumption to Challenge**: *Social media exposure uniformly increases appearance-related mental health issues across all adolescent populations.*

**Alternative Hypothesis**: *Social media's impact on adolescent mental health is mediated by specific platform features, cultural contexts, and protective factors, creating differential effects that can be predicted and mitigated.*

## Experimental Strategy

### Methodological Approach
- **Quasi-experimental designs** with comparison groups to establish causality
- **Cross-cultural validation** to test generalizability of findings
- **Longitudinal tracking** to measure developmental changes over time  
- **Mixed-methods analysis** combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights

### Evaluation Framework
Each experiment follows the CS research evaluation structure:
1. **Clear thesis statement** with testable predictions
2. **Identified assumptions** from prior work being challenged
3. **Dependent variables** (mental health outcomes to measure)
4. **Independent variables** (factors to manipulate or compare)
5. **Validity controls** addressing confounding factors
6. **Success criteria** with quantitative thresholds

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Cross-Cultural Platform Feature Impact Analysis

**Thesis Statement**: Different social media platform features (filters, likes, algorithmic curation) have culturally-mediated effects on adolescent body image, with protective cultural factors moderating negative impacts.

**Literature Assumption Being Challenged**: Prior research assumes platform effects are uniform across cultures, but literature review reveals significant cultural variation (e.g., Indian vs. Italian students showing different vulnerability patterns).

**Hypotheses**:
- H1: Visual filters increase body dissatisfaction more in cultures with thin-ideal emphasis than collectivist cultures
- H2: Quantifiable feedback (likes/comments) shows stronger correlation with anxiety in individualistic cultures
- H3: Algorithmic curation of beauty content affects adolescents differently based on local beauty standard variations

**Methodology**:
- **Design**: 3x2x4 quasi-experimental design (3 platform features × 2 cultural contexts × 4 time points)
- **Participants**: 600 adolescents (ages 13-17) from USA and India (300 each)
- **Platform Features Tested**: 
  - High filter use vs. low filter use conditions
  - High quantifiable feedback vs. minimal feedback
  - Beauty-focused algorithmic feeds vs. diverse content feeds
- **Measures**: 
  - Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire (BIDQ)
  - Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI) 
  - Cultural Values Scale (CVS)
  - Social Media Use Questionnaire (SMUQ)
- **Timeline**: 8-week intervention with pre/mid/post/follow-up assessments

**Dependent Variables**:
- Appearance anxiety scores (primary)
- Body satisfaction ratings (secondary)
- Social comparison frequency (secondary)
- Help-seeking behavior (exploratory)

**Independent Variables**:
- Platform feature exposure (manipulated)
- Cultural context (USA vs. India)
- Individual cultural value orientation (measured covariate)

**Validity Controls**:
- Random assignment within cultural groups
- Baseline mental health screening
- Control for overall social media use time
- Attention checks for intervention compliance

**Success Metrics**:
- Effect size d > 0.5 for cultural moderation of platform effects
- Significant interaction between platform features and cultural context (p < 0.01)
- Identification of at least 2 protective cultural factors with medium effect sizes

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Filters show stronger negative effects in individualistic contexts
- Quantifiable feedback correlates more strongly with anxiety in USA sample
- Cultural protective factors (family support, collectivist values) moderate negative effects

### Experiment 2: Social Comparison Theory Mechanism Testing

**Thesis Statement**: The relationship between social media use and mental health is mediated by specific comparison processes that can be disrupted through targeted interventions, challenging the assumption that exposure alone determines outcomes.

**Literature Assumption Being Challenged**: Current research focuses on overall social media exposure as the primary risk factor, but mechanisms research suggests specific comparison processes drive negative outcomes.

**Hypotheses**:
- H1: Upward appearance comparisons mediate the relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction
- H2: Intervention targeting comparison processes reduces negative outcomes independent of usage reduction
- H3: Self-compassion training moderates the comparison-distress pathway

**Methodology**:

- Mechanism specificity: comparison intervention outperforms usage reduction alone

**Resource Requirements**:
- Mobile app development for intervention delivery
- Standardized social media content stimulus set
- Training for intervention facilitators

### Experiment 3: Gender-Differentiated Platform Effect Study

**Thesis Statement**: Social media platforms affect adolescent boys and girls through different psychological mechanisms, requiring gender-specific measurement approaches and interventions rather than universal solutions.

**Literature Assumption Being Challenged**: Most research focuses on girls' experiences or assumes similar mechanisms across genders, but emerging evidence suggests boys face distinct pressures around muscularity and stoicism.

**Hypotheses**:
- H1: Instagram use correlates with thin-ideal internalization in girls and muscularity ideal internalization in boys
- H2: TikTok use shows stronger associations with appearance anxiety in girls, social performance anxiety in boys  
- H3: Gender moderates the effectiveness of body-positive content interventions

- **Participants**: 480 adolescents (240 girls, 240 boys, ages 13-17)
- **Platform Focus**: Instagram vs. TikTok vs. mixed usage patterns
- **Intervention**: Body-positive content curation vs. control feed
- **Duration**: 6-week intervention with 2-week pre and post assessment periods

**Gender-Specific Measures**:
- **Girls**: Thin-Ideal Internalization Scale, Drive for Thinness Scale, Objectified Body Consciousness Scale
- **Boys**: Drive for Muscularity Scale, Male Body Attitudes Scale, Masculine Role Norm Scale
- **Both**: Social Physique Anxiety Scale, Social Media Disorder Scale, Appearance Comparison Scale

**Experimental Tasks**:
- **Platform-specific browsing sessions**: 20-minute controlled exposure with eye-tracking
