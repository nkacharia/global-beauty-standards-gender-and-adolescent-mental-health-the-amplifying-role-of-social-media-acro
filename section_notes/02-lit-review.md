# Literature Review

## Summary

The intersection of global beauty standards, social media, and adolescent mental health represents a rapidly evolving field with substantial implications for youth wellbeing. This literature review synthesizes current research across theoretical frameworks, empirical findings, and cross-cultural perspectives to understand how digital platforms amplify appearance-based pressures and their differential impacts across gender and cultural contexts.

The literature reveals converging evidence that social media platforms create what Choukas-Bradley et al. (2022) term a "perfect storm" for adolescent body image concerns. This occurs through the intersection of platform features (idealized imagery, quantifiable feedback, algorithmic curation) with developmental vulnerabilities (peer relationship salience, identity formation) and sociocultural pressures (gender socialization, beauty ideal internalization). Theoretical frameworks including Social Comparison Theory, Objectification Theory, and Self-Discrepancy Theory provide robust explanatory mechanisms for these effects.

Research consistently demonstrates gender-differentiated impacts, with adolescent girls showing heightened vulnerability to appearance-based social comparison and internalization of thin-ideal beauty standards, while emerging evidence suggests boys face distinct pressures around muscularity and stoicism. Cross-cultural research reveals that beauty standard impacts vary significantly by cultural context, with Western thinness ideals, South Asian colorism, East Asian perfectionism, and post-colonial Eurocentric standards creating distinct risk patterns.

## Key Papers

### Paper 1: Social Media and Upward Social Comparison
- **Title**: The Impact of Upward Social Comparison on Social Media on Appearance Anxiety: A Moderated Mediation Model
- **Authors**: Tian, J., Li, B., Zhang, R. (2024)
- **Key Findings**: Upward social comparison significantly predicts appearance anxiety (β = 0.546); self-objectification mediates 21% of this relationship; self-compassion moderates the USC-self-objectification pathway
- **Relevance**: Provides empirical evidence for specific psychological mechanisms linking social media comparison to mental health outcomes, identifying both risk and protective factors

### Paper 2: Theoretical Framework for Girls' Vulnerability  
- **Title**: The Perfect Storm: A Developmental–Sociocultural Framework for the Role of Social Media in Adolescent Girls' Body Image Concerns and Mental Health
- **Authors**: Choukas-Bradley, S., Nesi, J., et al. (2022)
- **Key Findings**: Social media features intersect with developmental factors and gender socialization to disproportionately affect girls; body image concerns serve as key mediator between social media use and mental health
- **Relevance**: Establishes comprehensive theoretical framework explaining gender differences in social media effects and identifies body image as central mechanism

### Paper 3: Cross-Cultural Body Image Research
- **Title**: Body Image and Self-Esteem in Indian and Italian University Students: Cross-Cultural Insights for Psychiatric Well-Being
- **Authors**: Abdoli, M., Nayak, O., et al. (2025)  
- **Key Findings**: Indian students show higher self-esteem and more positive body image than Italian counterparts; cultural values provide protective effects; self-esteem-body image relationships vary by cultural context
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates cultural specificity of beauty standard impacts and importance of cultural context in understanding protective and risk factors

### Paper 4: Colonial Beauty Standards Impact
- **Title**: The Impact of Colonial Beauty Standards on the Ethnic Identity and Mental Health of Filipina Americans
- **Authors**: Tirona, C.M.G. (2023)
- **Key Findings**: Six themes including media overrepresentation of Eurocentric standards, familial reinforcement, mental health consequences, and ethnic identity complications; intergenerational transmission patterns identified
- **Relevance**: Reveals how historical colonialism creates lasting beauty standard impacts across generations, highlighting need for culturally-informed interventions

### Paper 5: Platform-Specific Gender Effects
- **Title**: Comparing the Impact of Screen Time Modes on Body Image for Men and Women  
- **Authors**: Zhou, N. (2024)
- **Key Findings**: Social media negatively correlates with body image for both genders; television viewing affects women only; gaming shows no significant correlation for either gender
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates platform-specific effects and need for nuanced approaches to screen time research that consider both medium type and gender

### Paper 6: Korean Wave Global Influence
- **Title**: Impact of Korean Wave on Eating Disorders: A Comparative Study
- **Authors**: Kumari, A. (2024)
- **Key Findings**: Korean Wave followers scored significantly higher on eating disorder scales than non-followers; K-pop beauty standards create distinct international risk patterns
- **Relevance**: Shows globalization of beauty standards now includes East Asian influences, expanding beyond Western-centric models

### Paper 7: Identity Development and Social Media
- **Title**: Effects of Social Media Social Comparisons and Identity Processes on Body Image Satisfaction in Late Adolescence  
- **Authors**: Croatian research team (2023)
- **Key Findings**: Different body image domains show distinct patterns; identity commitment/exploration more important for attribution domain while social media comparison crucial for appearance/weight satisfaction
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates interaction between developmental processes and social media effects, suggesting targeted intervention approaches by developmental stage

## Research Gaps

### Theoretical Gaps
1. **Limited Theoretical Integration**: Most studies apply single theoretical frameworks rather than integrated approaches that could better capture complex social media effects
2. **Cultural Adaptation Needed**: Existing theories developed in Western contexts require adaptation for non-Western populations and colonial histories
3. **Platform-Specific Theory Development**: Theories need updating for different social media platform features and algorithmic functions

### Methodological Gaps  
1. **Longitudinal Research Shortage**: Most studies are cross-sectional, limiting causal inference about social media's developmental effects
2. **Intersectionality Under-examined**: Limited research on how multiple identities (gender, race, class, sexuality) interact with beauty standard pressures
3. **Non-Western Population Underrepresentation**: Research heavily skewed toward Western populations despite global social media reach

### Content Gaps
1. **Intervention Research Limited**: Few studies examine effective interventions for mitigating social media's negative body image effects
2. **Positive Social Media Use Understudied**: Limited research on how social media might be used to promote positive body image and mental health
3. **Emerging Technologies Unexamined**: Research lags behind new platform features (AI filters, deepfakes, virtual influencers)
4. **Male and Non-Binary Experiences**: Continued underrepresentation of non-female experiences in body image research

### Cultural and Contextual Gaps
1. **Limited African, Middle Eastern, Latin American Research**: Major geographic regions underrepresented in literature  
2. **Socioeconomic Factors Under-explored**: Limited examination of how economic status mediates beauty standard pressures
3. **Rural vs. Urban Context Differences**: Most research conducted in urban, educated populations
4. **Family and Community Intervention Points**: Limited research on how to engage families and communities in addressing beauty standard pressures

This literature review reveals a field in rapid development with strong theoretical foundations and growing empirical evidence, but significant opportunities remain for expanding cultural understanding, methodological rigor, and intervention development.
