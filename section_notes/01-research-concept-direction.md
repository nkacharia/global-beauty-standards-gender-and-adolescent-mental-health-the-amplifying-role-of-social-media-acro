# Research Concept & Direction

## Overview

“One in three teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” revealed an internal Facebook study 3. This stark finding, leaked to the press, highlights a growing concern: global beauty standards – the often unrealistic ideals of bodily perfection circulated worldwide – may be harming adolescents’ mental health. Today’s teens are coming of age in a globalized beauty culture where the pressure to conform is amplified by social media’s ubiquity. Nearly 95% of 13–17-year-olds are on social media (with one-third using it “almost constantly”) 8, exposing them continuously to images of “ideal” faces and bodies. At the same time, we are witnessing what health officials call a youth mental health crisis, with depression and anxiety on the rise 8. How do beauty ideals affect boys and girls differently, and how do platforms like Instagram and TikTok turbo-charge these effects across cultures? This paper explores these questions.

Thesis: Global beauty standards negatively impact adolescent mental health for all genders, but girls tend to be more deeply affected than boys, experiencing greater body anxiety and depression tied to appearance pressures. Social media acts as a force-multiplier by algorithmically reinforcing these ideals through filtered images and influencer content, though the specific effects vary across cultures. Adolescent girls often internalize a thin, flawless ideal of beauty (leading to higher rates of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders), whereas boys feel pressured to be muscular and “manly” (contributing to anxiety or muscle dysmorphia)5. Using theories like Social Comparison and Objectification, we will explain how these gendered pressures take root. We will also compare Western and non-Western beauty norms – for example, the slim, tanned ideal common in the U.S. versus fair skin preferences in India – to see how cultural context mediates mental health outcomes. Finally, the paper will evaluate solutions: how parents, educators, and social media companies can intervene to protect adolescent well-being in the face of harmful beauty ideals.
