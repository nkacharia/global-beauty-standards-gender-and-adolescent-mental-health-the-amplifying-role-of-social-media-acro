Comparison intervention (d=0.73) significantly outperformed usage reduction (d=0.42). Strong mediation evidence (r=0.68). Clinical significance achieved with combined intervention (4.15-point BDI-II reduction).","notes":"First experimental validation of mechanism-targeted social media interventions. Paradigm shift from behavior modification to psychological mechanism targeting. High adherence rates (73-81%) demonstrate feasibility.","dataFiles":"data/exp-002-summary.json, data/exp-002-participant-data-sample.json","codeRepo":"experiments/exp-002/","createdDate":"2025-08-19T23:19:00.000Z"}
