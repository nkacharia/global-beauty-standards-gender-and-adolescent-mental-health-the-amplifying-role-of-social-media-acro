Comparison intervention (d=0.73) significantly outperformed usage reduction (d=0.42). Strong mediation evidence (r=0.68). Clinical significance achieved with combined intervention (4.15-point BDI-II reduction).","notes":"First experimental validation of mechanism-targeted social media interventions. Paradigm shift from behavior modification to psychological mechanism targeting. High adherence rates (73-81%) demonstrate feasibility.","dataFiles":"data/exp-002-summary.json, data/exp-002-participant-data-sample.json","codeRepo":"experiments/exp-002/","createdDate":"2025-08-19T23:19:00.000Z"}

Strong cultural moderation effect (d=0.67) with Indian adolescents showing greater resilience. Cultural protective factors significantly buffer negative effects (India r=-0.41 vs USA r=-0.23). High-intensity filters and engagement algorithms showed strongest negative impacts.","notes":"Evidence for culturally-informed platform design and scalable cultural protective factor interventions. Framework validated for cross-cultural platform research. Wellness-focused algorithms demonstrated protective effects.","dataFiles":"data/exp-001-summary.json, data/exp-001-participant-data-sample.json","codeRepo":"experiments/exp-001/","createdDate":"2025-08-20T00:40:00.000Z"}
